# Course Schedule

Expect changes in dates and topics as the course will change to meet our needs as they develop.

* **Activities** lists the general activities for the day in the context of the topics.
* **HW** (i.e. homework) is the thinking or activities to be done in preparation for the following day(s), and 
* **PB** (i.e. process book) are some prompts to consider in documenting your process.

 Denotes a coding topic, roughly speaking.

Daily slides are posted to Basecamp.

***Note that some days display two tracks (Design and Dev) for activities and homework to indicate role differences.***

## PHASE 1. Basic Skills, Fundamental Concepts, Research

### Week 1.   Welcome, we are a design office 

***Objectives:*** *Get us up and running as a design office. Cover the logistics and necessary course details. Kickoff the project.*

**8/26 M  Day 1** Introductions - who are we and what is this class about?, Course logistics

> * **Activities**: Apples-to-Apples; Get to know our collective skills
> * **HW**: Write your bio and brainstorm ideas for our office “self representations”
> * **HW**: Tool invites, don't be afraid. Kyle will be sending you invites to:

    * GitHub (see email from Kyle)
    * Google Docs (see email from Kyle)

**8/27 TU  Day 2** What will we be doing? - Collaboration, Project Management, Process documentation; Course Progression, Topics, Schedule;

> *  What is an iPad technically speaking?; What is an app?;
> * **Activities**:Muddy point; Setup laptops; Review tools; Intro to Project Management; Process Documentation;
    * Review HW
> * **HW/PB**: Consider your personal experience at ‘Iolani. 
    * What are some of your pet peeves?
    * What are some things you love?
    * Have a discussion about this with someone else (family, friend, faculty, etc.).
    * What did you learn from the exchange? about them? about you? about the topics?
> * **PB**:
    * What are your personal values?
    * How do you feel about the introduction of this technology? Fears? Desires? Unknowns?

**8/28 W**  No class meeting

**8/29 TH  Day 3** Project Kickoff! Ethics; Goals; Constraints; What are our assumptions?

> * **Activities**: 
    * Discuss HW (Review pet peeves & what you love); 
    * Defining ‘Iolani and Community - 5Ws & H;
    * Mind-maps
> * **HW**: Fill in your part of the ‘Iolani Who, What, When, Where, Why, & How shared document.
> * **PB**: How do you want an app to make you/others feel? What do you want to put out in the world?

**8/30 F  Day 4** What are our opportunities? - identify areas of interest; Project scope 

> * **Activities**: SWOT analysis; Brainstorming
> * **HW/PB**: What do you think you want to create? What are your assumptions about what you can or cannot create?
    * [Download an app and evaluate your experience](https://docs.google.com/a/iolani.org/document/d/135_Ek4JC2QDbDcFvzzCGoAOUUMYy3TQwu5zEKL9j__M/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Review our various insights based on research to date. Who do you think you would want to build an app for? Are there any specific opportunities of interest to you? Pick two "directions".
    * Find a laptop case, cover, or carrying solution. If you think you might be interested in doing some of the design work, you might end up switching to a 15" Macbook Pro. So, it might be best to find something that fits either computer.

### Week 2.  Design is about people 

***Objective:*** *Introduction to research in the context of business and design considerations*

**9/2 M** No class meeting

**9/3 TU  Day 5**  What is the iPad? What is an app?

> * **Activities**: Share out app reviews; Discuss some of the technical details of iPads and apps.

> * **HW**: Hear what Steve Job's has to say about life in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw&feature=youtu.be&t=9s) (< 2min)
     * Have you had an experience like this?
     * Is it possible to think of what that might be like if you haven't?
     * Could this class help? Is this related to the "agency" idea we mentioned on day 1?
> * **HW**: Listen to Steve Job's [Commencement Address to Stanford in 2005](https://vimeo.com/69898831) (~15min)
     * Why is this talk ironic?
     * How far will school take you? Does your own initiative play a role in success?
     * Steve Jobs had opinions. Strong opinions. You don't have to agree with him. But, you can't argue with his ability to figure out what he wanted and then create it.
     * Think about what Jobs says about "time." This is a short class, every class period counts. Don't waste it.
> * **HW**: As you continue your day. Write down the first thing that bothers you about your iPad. Also, the first thing that bothers you about ‘Iolani. Report back tomorrow.
> * **HW**: Share a goal of yours with someone you know. Anyone. Report back tomorrow. You chose the format of sharing.

> * **Activities**: Let's figure out how this Xcode things works. And, what are all the steps in building an app with it?
> * **HW**: [LAB 2: Complete the setup process for your developer certificate and deploy an app to your iPad.][LAB2]
> * **HW**: [Review the research we've done so far](https://basecamp.com/1826635/projects/3661215-agencyagency/documents/3764793-early-research) and consider whether there are two audiences, topics, issues that are of interest to you? (Ex. Tardies/Attendance Office and Students) Have them ready so we can just share and determine if we want to focus our field work at this point. How you choose is up to you. What do you want to work on this semester? Who do you want to help? What school processes do you want to learn more about?
> * **HW**: Think about the qualities that you want in your teachers. I will give you time to talk together and start creating a rubric for Kyle & me (and potentially for teachers in general).
> * **HW**: Write up your "typical Iolani day." Everyone please create your own Google Doc and share it with the class. What do you do and when (approximate time/durations) from when you wake up through till you go to bed. I don't need explicit details (what you ate for lunch) unless it's part of the "typical" decisions of you make. I would want to know things like whether you walked to your locker to get your lunch, carried it around with you all day, or went to buy it from somewhere (and where). If it helps, just write down what you did on Tuesday of this week. It'll just help us to understand things like personal process flows and we can do more to look for patterns. Step through it like you're talking to someone who hasn't ever gone to school before (has no assumptions about your routine).
> * **HW-ish**: You don't need your laptop Thursday or Friday. I'll extend the app LAB on Friday, based on feedback between now and then.
> * **HW-ish**: Bring a digital camera/iphone/ipad in case we have time to start our field research.
> * **PB**: Whenever we ask you to "think about" something. Or, share something. Put it in your process book, unless you want to email it, post it, Muddy Point it, or talk about it in person.
     
**9/5 TH  Day 7** Ethnographic methods - observe, listen, and ask questions

> * **Activities**: Review typical days and discuss patterns, example walk around campus, take notes & photos (finishing up 5Ws & H)
> * **HW**: Start taking photos to help illustrate your typical day write-up. Look for physical traces.
> * **HW/PB**: Start writing some possible survey questions for your selected audience and topic. Do you have any assumptions about what you expect to see/hear out in "the field" (interviews, photo ethnography)? Write them down as well.
         
**9/6 F  Day 8** Field research

> * **Activities**: Split up and create process maps and formulate questions for research next steps
> * **HW**: Continue creating process map (try creating digital version), writing up survey/interview questions, taking photos of artifacts/processes.
> * **HW**: [LAB 3: Continue learning about Storyboard fundamentals][LAB3], by adding segues.
> * **HW**: Create teacher assessment rubric (class to collaborate on your own doc). 
> * **PB**: What do you hope to learn from the interview? Hypotheses on what some the problems/challenges might be?
