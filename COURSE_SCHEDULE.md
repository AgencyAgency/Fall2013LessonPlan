# Course Schedule

Expect changes in dates and topics as the course will change to meet our needs as they develop.

* **Activities** lists the general activities for the day in the context of the topics.
* **HW** (i.e. homework) is the thinking or activities to be done in preparation for the following day(s), and 
* **PB** (i.e. process book) are some prompts to consider in documenting your process.

 Denotes a coding topic, roughly speaking.

***Note that some days display two tracks (Design and Dev) for activities and homework to indicate role differences.***

## PHASE 2. Design & Build

I'll transfer this part over later. In the meantime, here's a Wikipedia article on the [Design-Build concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design–build) as applies to architecture.
