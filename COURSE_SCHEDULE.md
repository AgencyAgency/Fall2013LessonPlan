# Course Schedule

Expect changes in dates and topics as the course will change to meet our needs as they develop.

* **Activities** lists the general activities for the day in the context of the topics.
* **HW** (i.e. homework) is the thinking or activities to be done in preparation for the following day(s), and 
* **PB** (i.e. process book) are some prompts to consider in documenting your process.

 Denotes a coding topic, roughly speaking.

Daily slides are posted to Basecamp.

***Note that some days display two tracks (Design and Dev) for activities and homework to indicate role differences.***

## PHASE 1. Basic Skills, Fundamental Concepts, Research

### Week 1.   Welcome, we are a design office

    * Review our various insights based on research to date. Who do you think you would want to build an app for? Are there any specific opportunities of interest to you? Pick two "directions".
    * Find a laptop case, cover, or carrying solution. If you think you might be interested in doing some of the design work, you might end up switching to a 15" Macbook Pro. So, it might be best to find something that fits either computer.

## PHASE 2. Design & Build

I'll transfer this part over later. In the meantime, here's a Wikipedia article on the [Design-Build concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design–build) as applies to architecture.
